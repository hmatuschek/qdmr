  <title>Group list table</title>
</info>

<para>
  Group lists are simple named lists of one or more contacts. These lists may include group,
  all or even private calls. Group lists are assigned to channels. They form a group of
  contacts (e.g., talk groups) you may want to listen to on a particular channel. Usually these
  group lists form a collection of talk groups that are specific for a particular region.

<para>
  Group lists are defined within the config file like

</informalexample>

<para>
  The group list table starts with the keyword "Grouplist". The following keywords (Name &amp;
  Contacts) are ignored, but form a kind of self-documentation for the config file.
</para>

<para>
  Following the "Grouplist" keyword, each group list is defined by a single line. The first
  column specifies the internal unique ID for the group list. This can be any number as long as
  it is unique. The second column contains the name of the group list as a string. This can be
  any non-empty string. The third column contains the comma-separated list of contact IDs that form
  that group list.
