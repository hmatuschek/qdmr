<para>
  These contacts can be personal contacts like DM3MAT, so-called all-calls and group calls.
  The contact table starts with the "Contact" keyword and ends with an empty line. The remaining
  keywords ("Name", "Type", "ID", "RxTone") are ignored, however, they are part of the
  self-documentation of the config file.
</para>

<para>
  Following the "Contact" keyword, each line
  represents a single contact in the contact list. The first column represents a unique
  internal ID for the contact. It must not necessarily be in ascending order, any unique number
  will do. The second column is the name of the contact. Any string can be used here. The third
  column specifies the type of the contact. This must be one of the keywords "Private", "Group"
  or "All", meaning private, group or all-calls, respectively. The fourth column specifies the DMR ID
  for the contact. Please note, that an all-call requires the specific DMR ID 16777215 to work
  as an all-call. The last colum specifies, whether an incoming call from this contact will cause a
  ring-tone. Here "+" means enabled/yes and "-" disabled/no.
