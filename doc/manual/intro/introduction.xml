  <title>Introduction</title>

  <abstract>
    <para>
      The chapter tries to provide an introduction to <acronym>DMR</acronym>
      (digital mobile radio) targeted at the unexperienced operator and anyone
      interested in this topic. I try to hide details until it gets absolutely 
      necessary to explain them. The majority of DMR introductions I've found, 
      are more or less extensive glossaries (if you are interested in that, see 
      <xref linkend="glossary"/>). They are hard to comprehend, unless one has at 
      least some experience with DMR. 
    </para>

      The perceived complexity of DMR comes from its origin as a radio standard
      for commercial applications at large events and companies (i.e., 
      <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunked_radio_system">trunked
      radio</link>). Therefore, I will first describe an example how DMR is used commercially
      before I describe how it is used in amateur radio. I hope that this approach will make some
      of the weird terms and concepts of DMR clearer.
