<para>
  Some radios support the prediction of satellite passes and also ease satellite operations by 
  correcting doppler shifts of up- and downlink frequencies. To this end, this feature turns a
  cheap handheld radio in a fully fledged satellite station. 
</para>

<para>
  The satellite editor dialog allows to select which satellites will be tracked by the device. The 
  dialog also allows to specify the up- and downlink frequencies for the chosen satellites.

  To add a new satellite, click the <guilabel>Add</guilabel> button at the bottom of the dialog. 
  You will be presented with a selection dialog of all known satellites.

<para> 
  The list of all known (amateur radio) satellites is huge. You may search for a name using the 
  <shortcut><keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo></shortcut> shortcut. 
</para>

<para>
  Once all satellites are added you are interested in, you can edit the transponder frequencies. 
  In qdmr, a satellite may have an FM transponder, an APRS transponder and a beacon. At least one 
  of these features should be configured. 
</para>

<para>
  The uplink (from earth to satellite) or transmit frequency as well as the downlink (from 
  satellite to earch) or receive frequency can be entered directly or selected from a known set of
  frequencies. To change a frequency, simply double-clock the field in the table.

<para>
  Some satellites also require a sub-tone (CTCSS). These tones can be selected from the dropdown 
  menu for up- and downlink separately.
</para>

<para>
  Once all satellites and their transponders are set up, you can write the configuration to the 
  radio using <guimenuitem>Write satellites</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Device</guimenu> menu.
