<para>
  The second tab is the <guilabel>Contact List</guilabel>. Here all DMR contacts are defined, 
  irrespective of their type. It is not only possible to define digital DMR contacts (i.e., 
  private, group and all calls) but also DTMF contacts (and in future two-tone, five-tone contacts
  too). This eases the control of the <glossterm>EchoLink</glossterm> feature of repeaters.

<para>
  You may add a contact by clicking on the <guibutton>Add Contact</guibutton> button at the bottom. 
  You can also delete a contact by selecting the contact in the list and clicking on the 
  <guibutton>Delete Contact</guibutton> button at the bottom. You may also reorder the contacts by 
  selecting a contact in the list and use the <guibutton>arrow-up</guibutton> and 
  <guibutton>arrow-down</guibutton> buttons on the right to move the contact up and
  down the list, respectively.

<para>
  When you create a code-plug, the contact list should contain all talk groups and reflectors you
  are interested in, as well as a so-called <glossterm>All Call</glossterm> contact to the number
  <emphasis>16777215</emphasis>. Additionally you may add private calls to several operators you 
  know, as well as some <emphasis>service numbers</emphasis>.

<para>
  When you click on the <guibutton>Add Contact</guibutton> button or when you double-click a 
  contact entry in the list, the <guilabel>Edit Contact</guilabel> dialog will appear. The first 
  drop-down box allows to choose the type of the call. The possible options are <glossterm>Private 
  Call</glossterm>, <glossterm>Group Call</glossterm> and <glossterm>All Call</glossterm>. The second 
  entry is the name of the contact. Here any text can be entered. The third entry is the number of
  the contact. This entry gets disabled when <glossterm>All Call</glossterm> is selected as the 
  call-type. Finally, if the last option <guilabel>Rx Tone</guilabel> is enabled, you will hear a 
  ring-tone whenever this contact calls you.
</para>

<tip>
  <para>
    <application>qdmr</application> tries to download the current list of all registered user DMR IDs.
    The contact dialog will use this information (once downloaded) to resolve call-signs to DMR IDs.
    Just start entering the call-sign into the name field and matching call-signs are shown. 
  </para>
  <para>
    The same holds true for Brandmeister <glossterm>Talkgroup</glossterm> names. That is, start 
    typing the name of a talk group and a drop-down list of talk group names will appear for 
    auto-completion. Select the talk group and its DMR ID gets set.
  </para>
</tip>

<para>
  If <guilabel>Show device extensions</guilabel> is enabled in the settings dialog (see 
  <xref linkend="guiSettingsDialog"/>), a tab bar is shown at the top. There you can also access
  the device specific settings for contacts.

<para>
  Beside DMR contacts, the contact list may also contain analog DTMF contacts. You can add a new DTMF 
  contact by clicking on the <guibutton>Add DTMF contact</guibutton> button. This will open the 
  <guilabel>Edit DTMF contact</guilabel> dialog (see above). This is a rather simple dialog. 
</para>
<para>
  <guilabel>Name</guilabel> specifies the name of the DTMF contact, while <guilabel>Number</guilabel>
  specifies the DTMF number. There, any DTMF number can be entered, this includes symbols like *, #, 
  A-D. The <guilabel>Ring</guilabel> option specifies whether the radio should ring if a call by this
  contact is received.
