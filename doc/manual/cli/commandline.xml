  <title>The <command>dmrconf</command> command line tool</title>
</info>

<para>
  Beside the graphical user interface provided by <application>qdmr</application> (see 
  <xref linkend="gui"/>), there is also a command line tool allowing to read/write codeplugs from 
  and to the radios. It is based on the same library called 
  <link xlink:href="https://dm3mat.darc.de/qdmr/libdmrconf">libdmrconf</link> and thus provides the
  same features like <application>qdmr</application>.
</para>

<para>
  This chapter will briefly describe the command line tool and how it can be used to handle 
  codeplugs from the command line.
</para>

<para>
  The command line tool might be helpful in cases, where the codeplug file (see 
  <xref linkend="codeplug"/>) gets assembled by a script. Then the same script may
  upload the codeplug to the radio using the command line tool.
</para>

<para>
  Additionally to the the features of the GUI (see <xref linkend="gui"/>), the command line tool
  provides some features to analyze the memory representation of the binary codeplugs as well as 
  debugging their implementation.
