<para>
  The sole reason for introducing a new YAML based codeplug format was the ability to extend the
  file format with device specific settings without breaking the format. This was simply impossible 
  with the <emphasis>old</emphasis> table based text files.

<para>
  The present YAML based codeplug file format is extensible at almost any level. That is, device 
  specific elements can be added to single codeplug elements like channels, zones or contacts but 
  also to the codeplug itself. The latter allows to extend the codeplug with new elements.
