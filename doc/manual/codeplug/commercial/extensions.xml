<para>
  DMR was developed as a digital replacement of the analog trunked radio systems used in commercial
  context. To this end, there are many features of that are irrelevant or outright forbidden in an
  amateur radio context. However, some HAM operators use their hand-held radios also for their 
  day job and thus may need to configure some features that are only applicable in a commercial
  context. To this end, qdmr allows to set some of the commercial features through extensions.

<warning>
  <para>
    Some commercial features defined within the DMR standard are illegal to use in an amateur 
    radio context. Check your local regulations!
