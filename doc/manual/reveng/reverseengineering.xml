<para>
  The majority of the development time needed for <application>qdmr</application>, consists of 
  reverse engineering the codeplug and communication protocols of the radios. Fortunately, many 
  radios share the same communication protocol, in particular those from the same manufacturer.
  But sometimes these protocols are also used by other manufacturers. Even if the protocol is 
  already implemented in <application>qdmr</application>, you may need to reverse engineer the 
  codeplug format. This step has to be performed always, even if a already implemented codeplug
  is reused, you will need to verify that format. Any mistake here, may brick your device.

    Before you attempt to reverse engineer anything, consider to invest some significant time in 
    research. Reverse engineering is an cumbersome and frequently frustrating task, there is no
    need to waste your valuable time on something, that someone else has already done. Also, 
    consider documenting and publishing your results, so others can find it, even if it is 
    incomplete.

  In the following sections, I attempt to describe, how I approach reverse engineering the 
  communication protocols and codeplugs. To this end, I hope it might help you in your reverse 
  engineering work. And if you like, you may contribute your work to qdmr.
