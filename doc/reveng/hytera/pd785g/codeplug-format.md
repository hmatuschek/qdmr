# Hytera PD785G codeplug format

## Differential analysis

It appears as though the act of writing the same codeplug to the radio does
cause diffs. The following diff is generated:

```diff

We can therefore disregard any changes seen at these addresses when changing CP
values.  Any diffs shown in this document will filter out these changes.

### Programming time stamp 
Haveing a look at the transferred data, there is a dedicated write of 6 bytes to address 
0x00000094. Here this would correspond to 
```
e5 07 03 16 02 17
```
being replaced by 
```
e5 07 03 16 02 1a
```
 - 07e3 03 16 02 17-> 2021-03-16, 02:23
 - 07e3 03 16 02 1a-> 2021-03-16, 02:26

### SHA1 HMACs?!?
The other two changes are certainly worrying: These are both 160bit blocks and they change completely without changing the code-plug at all (except for the suspected programming time stamp). This would imply a cryptographic hash function over parts or the compete code-plug. A likely candidate would be SHA1. 

The latter, however, does not make sense as a kind of checksum. This can be done cheaper using CRC32, in particular as many MCUs have dedicated hardware to compute such checksums. SHA1 would make sense if it is used as a HMAC. If this turns out to be true, then we will never be able to programm these Hytera devices.


## DMR ID

Changing the DMRID of the radio (from 1 to 12345678) results in the following
changes:

```diff

---
> 000D5FF0 ff 00 00 00 00 00 0a bc 61 4e 0a e1 00 00 ff 00 | ........aN......

``` 

- The first diff indicates that the DMRID is stored at address 0x65aaa as three
  bytes LE.
  
- The second diff indicates a byte has changed at address 0x65acc, perhaps some
  kind of checksum?
  
- The third diff shows that the DMRID is stored at address 0xd5ff7 as three
  bytes BE.

## Channels
### Frequency Format (`freq_t`)

Frequencies appear to be stored as 32-bit unsigned fixed-point LE values. For
example the frequency 450.71250MHz is encoded as `b4 53 dd 1a`, which when
interpreted as a 32-bit unsigned LE integer yields `450712500`.

## Digitial
### Layout

```c
typedef uint32_t freq_t // 32-bit fixed point frequency

typedef struct
{
    ...
    freq_t rx_freq;
    freq_t tx_freq;
    ...
} digital_chan_t;

```

### TX and RX frequency

For the same digitial channel an RX frequency was seen to change at address
`0x3ab4e`. The TX frequency was seen to change at address `0x3ab52`.

## Digitial Contacts

Contacts start at address `0x65b70` and runs to `0x71b70` thus allowing for a
maximum of 1024 contacts. Each record has the format:

```c
typedef uint16_t unicode_char_t;

// 0 - private call
// 1 - group call
typedef uint8_t call_type_t;

typedef struct
{
    uint16_t index;
    unicode_char_t name[16];
    call_type_t call_type;
    uint8_t unk0;
    uint16_t __pad_1;
    uint32_t id;
    uint32_t unk1;
    uint16_t link;
}

```

### Contact traversal

Not all slots in the address range contain valid contacts; some may be empty or
some may contain old contact data. In order to filter out these contacts and
find only valid contacts, we need to use the `link` field to establish a link of
valid contacts. We begin at the first slot, located at `0x65b70` and continue
until we find a contact that has a `link` back to the `idx` 0.

As an example, lets take `base.hex` and add one contact. This results in the
following contact data (empty data has been omitted):

```
0x00065b70  0000 4300 6100 6c00 6c00 2000 3100 0000  ..C.a.l.l. .1...
0x00065b80  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
0x00065b90  0000 0101 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0100  ................
0x00065ba0  0200 4300 6100 6c00 6c00 3100 0000 0000  ..C.a.l.l.1.....
0x00065bb0  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
0x00065bc0  0000 1101 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
0x00065bd0  0100 6e00 6500 7700 6e00 6500 7700 6e00  ..n.e.w.n.e.w.n.
0x00065be0  6500 7700 6e00 6500 7700 6e00 6500 7700  e.w.n.e.w.n.e.w.
0x00065bf0  6e00 0000 0000 4e61 bc00 0000 0000 0000  n.....Na........
```

We can cast this data using the structure above to obtain three channel 'slots'
with the following data:

```
slot[0] =
       idx : 0x00065b70 = 0x0000
      name : 0x00065b72 = "C"
 call_type : 0x00065b92 = 0x01
      unk0 : 0x00065b93 = 0x01
     __pad : 0x00065b94 = 0x0000
        id : 0x00065b96 = 1
      unk1 : 0x00065b9a = 0
      link : 0x00065b9e = 0x0001

slot[1] =
       idx : 0x00065ba0 = 0x0002
      name : 0x00065ba2 = "C"
 call_type : 0x00065bc2 = 0x11
      unk0 : 0x00065bc3 = 0x01
     __pad : 0x00065bc4 = 0x0000
        id : 0x00065bc6 = 1
      unk1 : 0x00065bca = 0
      link : 0x00065bce = 0x0000

slot[2] =
       idx : 0x00065bd0 = 0x0001
      name : 0x00065bd2 = "n"
 call_type : 0x00065bf2 = 0x00
      unk0 : 0x00065bf3 = 0x00
     __pad : 0x00065bf4 = 0x0000
        id : 0x00065bf6 = 12345678
      unk1 : 0x00065bfa = 0
      link : 0x00065bfe = 0x0000
```

If we follow the algorithm above, we would walk along the indexes: `0 -> 1 -> 0`
this we can disregard slot 1 (which has an index of 2) as it is not part of the
link traversal.

A special case should be mentioned when there is only a single channel in the
code plug. I would have assumed that the link and index on the slot in question
would have both equaled 0 so the channel refers to itself. However, the CPS
appears to do something different:

```
0x00065b70  0000 4300 6100 6c00 6c00 2000 3100 0000  ..C.a.l.l. .1...
0x00065b80  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
0x00065b90  0000 0101 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0100  ................
0x00065ba0  0100 4300 6100 6c00 6c00 3100 0000 0000  ..C.a.l.l.1.....
0x00065bb0  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
0x00065bc0  0000 1101 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................

slot[0] =
       idx : 0x00065b70 = 0x0000
      name : 0x00065b72 = "C"
 call_type : 0x00065b92 = 0x01
      unk0 : 0x00065b93 = 0x01
     __pad : 0x00065b94 = 0x0000
        id : 0x00065b96 = 1
      unk1 : 0x00065b9a = 0
      link : 0x00065b9e = 0x0001

slot[1] =
       idx : 0x00065ba0 = 0x0001
      name : 0x00065ba2 = "C"
 call_type : 0x00065bc2 = 0x11
      unk0 : 0x00065bc3 = 0x01
     __pad : 0x00065bc4 = 0x0000
        id : 0x00065bc6 = 1
      unk1 : 0x00065bca = 0
      link : 0x00065bce = 0x0000
```

A 'dummy' node is created that links back to index 0. Notice on this node that
`call_type` is `0x11`. My assumption here is that the value `0x11` on call type
indicates this is a dummy node and should be ignored.
