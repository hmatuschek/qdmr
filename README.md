![qdmr channel editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmatuschek/qdmr/master/doc/fig/qdmr-channels.png "The qdmr CPS software.")

*qdmr* is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows to program several types of DMR radios.
To this end, it aims at being a more universal codeplug programming software (CPS) compared to the
device and even revision specific CPSs provided by the manufacturers. The goal of this project is to
provide a **single**, **comfortable**, [**well-documented**](https://dm3mat.darc.de/qdmr/manual/) 
and **platform-independent** CPS for several types of (mainly Chinese) DMR radios.
